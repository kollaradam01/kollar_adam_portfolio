			Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
			I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
			She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
			In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
			Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
			Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
			Didn't make sense not to live for fun
			Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
			So much to do, so much to see
			So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
			You'll never know if you don't go
			You'll never shine if you don't glow
			Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
			Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
			And all that glitters is gold
			Only shooting stars break the mold
			It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
			You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
			But the meteor men beg to differ
			Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
			The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
			The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
			My world's on fire, how about yours?
			That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
			Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
			Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
			All that glitters is gold
			Only shooting stars break the mold
			Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
			Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
			And all that glitters is gold
			Only shooting stars
			Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
			I need to get myself away from this place
			I said, "Yup" what a concept
			I could use a little fuel myself
			And we could all use a little change
			Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
			Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
			Didn't make sense not to live for fun
			Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
			So much to do, so much to see
			So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
			You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
			You'll never shine if you don't glow
			Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
			Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
			And all that glitters is gold
			Only shooting stars break the mold
			And all that glitters is gold
			Only shooting stars break the mold
